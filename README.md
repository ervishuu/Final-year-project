# Artificial Agriculture-Web-Application 🧑‍🌾

## ***PROBLEM STATEMENT*** 🧿

The plant diseases are such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The leaf diseases not only restrict the growth
of the plant but also destroy its crop.There is the need of some expert to identify plant diseases but manual identification is time consuming.

Furthermore, if someone need a farm animal, he must travel to each hamlet to locate the animal, which
takes time and money; therefore, this initiative wants to save time and money by making the animal
available to him.

Farmers don’t get the price they want since they don’t know whether the cost of their products will rise
or fall.

Farmers are having a lot of difficulty farming as a result of climate change. It would be simpler for them
to cultivate if they are aware of weather for the upcoming few days in advance.


## OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK 🎯

To make an efficient use of Image Processing by using camera which reduces time and cost for farmer to
detect the disease and suggest the fertilizers for plant.

We can also predict rainfall, allowing to choose which crop to plant. We will learn about the ecosystem
as well.

We will know what today’s market price is, and what the next 15 days will be . so we can sell goods
properly.

In addition, We will be able to buy and sell farmed animals online.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 🎉🏆

The experiments were performed on an Win10 workstation with CPU i7 and RAM 8GB, accelerated by NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPUs.
 All of our experiments were implemented by deep learning open source framework. Moreover, accuracy rate was used to evaluate the performance of network models. The accuracy rate refers to the proportion of the number of corrected positive predictions to that of the whole positive predictions. 
 
 It can be expressed as:
                            Accuracy (all correct / all) = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN

## CONCLUSION 📍

This proposed system describes different techniques of image processing for detecting plant diseases.

Farmers will also know which crops to plant in particular seasons and which crops are most suited to their cultivation.

The market prices of Indian commodities fluctuates geographically. To give a better understanding of these fluctuations to stakeholders and farmers, in this system, we have presented a short-term price forecasting model using ARIMA model which will eventually lead to more sustainability to different stakeholders.

We will also have the pets we desire, which we can keep or give to others, saving our time and money.

Weather forecasting can help with a farmer’s business decisions. Forecasts can help them plan for the many day-to-day decisions. These decisions include crop irrigation, time to fertilize, and what days are suitable for working in the field. The decisions that farmers make will result in a profitable crop or failure.
