# Artificial Agriculture-Web-Application üßë‚Äçüåæ

## PROBLEM STATEMENT üßø
 - The plant diseases are such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. The leaf diseases not only restrict the growth of the plant but also destroy its crop.There is the need of some expert to identify plant diseases but manual identification is time consuming.
 - Furthermore, if someone need a farm animal, he must travel to each hamlet to locate the animal, which takes time and money; therefore, this initiative wants to save time and money by making the animal available to him.
 - Farmers don‚Äôt get the price they want since they don‚Äôt know whether the cost of their products will rise
or fall.
 - Farmers are having a lot of difficulty farming as a result of climate change. It would be simpler for them
to cultivate if they are aware of weather for the upcoming few days in advance.


## OBJECTIVE OF THE PROPOSED WORK üéØ
 - To make an efficient use of Image Processing by using camera which reduces time and cost for farmer to detect the disease and suggest the fertilizers for plant.
 - We can also predict rainfall, allowing to choose which crop to plant. We will learn about the ecosystem as well.
 - We will know what today‚Äôs market price is, and what the next 15 days will be . so we can sell goods properly.
 - In addition, We will be able to buy and sell farmed animals online.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION üéâüèÜ
 - The experiments were performed on an Win10 workstation with CPU i7 and RAM 8GB, accelerated by NVIDIA GTX 1650 GPUs.
 - All of our experiments were implemented by deep learning open source framework. Moreover, accuracy rate was used to evaluate the performance of network models. 
 - The accuracy rate refers to the proportion of the number of corrected positive predictions to that of the whole positive predictions. 
 - It can be expressed as:
   - > Accuracy (all correct / all) = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN
